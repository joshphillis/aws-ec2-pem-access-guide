# 🔐 AWS EC2 Instance Deployment & PEM File SSH Access

This repository has been sanitized to remove all sensitive cloud resource identifiers, including login credentials, security group names, public IPs, VPC and subnet IDs, and resource deletion steps. Any environment-specific values presented (such as sample firewall rules or admin logins) have been intentionally generic and are used solely for instructional purposes.

All actions documented in this project follow Microsoft Azure best practices for authentication, access control, and resource protection. Always ensure keys, credentials, and infrastructure metadata are stored securely and never pushed to public repositories.

## Overview  
This project demonstrates launching an EC2 instance on **AWS** using a community-provided AMI, configuring security groups for HTTP and SSH access, and securely connecting to the instance via **PEM key-based authentication**. It serves as a foundational exercise in provisioning virtual machines, establishing secure connectivity, and understanding basic AWS networking principles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Amazon EC2** – Cloud-hosted virtual machine service  
- **Community AMI (`ami-06d5e0de6baf595ca`)** – Linux-based image for instance deployment  
- **Security Groups** – Inbound rules for ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP)  
- **Key Pair (.pem)** – RSA-based authentication for secure instance access  
- **AWS Console** – Instance provisioning and configuration  
- **Windows Command Line / PowerShell** – SSH command execution

## 📦 Project Workflow
1. Logged into AWS Console and selected **EC2 > Launch Instance**  
2. Chose a Community AMI and configured a **t2.micro** instance  
3. Created a new **security group** allowing TCP traffic on:
   - Port `22` for SSH
   - Port `80` for HTTP  
4. Generated an **RSA PEM key pair** and downloaded the `.pem` file  
5. Successfully launched the instance and verified status (2/2 checks passed)  
6. Connected via SSH using the command:

```bash
ssh -i "pgpcc-key1.pem" ec2-user@<Public-IP-Address>

## 🧪 Validation
- Verified shell access to Amazon Linux terminal  
- Confirmed instance details using `kubectl` and AWS Console  
- Tested public IP in browser and confirmed inbound traffic permissions  
- Ensured key fingerprint recognition and secure host listing

## ✅ Outcomes
- Gained experience launching and accessing EC2 instances securely  
- Practiced PEM-based authentication and SSH command structure  
- Configured security group rules and validated firewall behavior  
- Strengthened AWS fundamentals in networking and compute provisioning
